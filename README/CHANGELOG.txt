===============================
 1.) Premium plugin: File attachments. This plugin allows users to send 
     small files to each other.

     creating missing files).

     encoded (see rfc 2047). This should solve some problems with non ISO 
	 character codes and Outlook message readers.
11.) A small bug in some language files fixed. Translators should check
     following language strings (these have been fixed):
       _UDDEADM_MAINTENANCE_NOTFOUND
       _UDDEADM_MAINTENANCE_MT2

     in the email notification or not.
 2.) Maximum number of allowed recipients on a userlist is displayed in the 
     footer.
 3.) Appearance of menu bar can be chosen: text only, icons only, text and icons
 4.) New maintenance function: uddeIM uses two XML files to ensure that it can be 
     installed on Joomla 1.0 and 1.5. On Joomla 1.5 one XML file is not required 
     and this makes the extension manager to show an incompatibilty warning (which 
     is wrong). This removes the unnecessary files, so the warning is not longer 
     displayed.
 5.) A message can be directly trashed after sending.
 6.) English and german language files cleaned up (removed approx. 50 strings)
 7.) "Add CC: line" is checked by default now.
 8.) Javascript popup notification removed from mod_uddeIM (this mode was useless).
 9.) Some code optimizations (e.g. code for backend is 80kb(!) smaller).

     was not sent. This results in that pms_uddeim_contentlink has not worked.
11.) Support for forum component Kunena added.
12.) Support for community component JomSocial added.
13.) Premium plugin for donators: Spamcontrol System added in backend (allows 
     users to report spam, so the admin can take appropriate actions).
14.) New icon added to uddeIM standard templates.
15.) Some minor bugs removed from CSS template files and new style class added.
16.) New plugin: uddeIM Search Bot for Joomla, integrates Message Search in
     Joomla Search (note it is not possible to search inside messages when
     message obfuscating, encryption or base64 encoding is used).
17.) Registered users cannot send messages to CB/CBE banned users (special users can).
18.) CB/CBE banned users cannot use uddeIM.
19.) Due to some optimizations, several SQL queries removed.
20.) mod_uddeim did not display any notifications when "No output" was set to "Yes".
21.) Accounts can be locked in the backend. Locked accounts cannot be accessed but
     messages can still be received.
22.) Fixed a variable not found bug in cb_plug_pms_uddeim_profilelink.
23.) Following logic has been changed when uddeIM is in realname mode:
     When uddeIM 1.6 was called with parameter "recip=<id>" the realname was read 
     and used as recipient in the compose message dialog. The problem was that the
     message was send to the first user found when the realname was used by
     several people.
     uddeIM 1.7 does read the realname but the username when the realname is not
     unique. So the compose message dialog shows the username instead even when
     uddeIM uses realnames.
24.) The Itemid is requested for profile links, so problems with 3rd party SEF
     should be fixed.
25.) A notification is displayed when "email stopp" is active.
26.) Path to captcha font added (a very few systems had problems without).
27.) Only users logged into the frontend are shown online.
28.) When a name starts with a "#", uddeIM first checks if a corresponding userlist 
     exists and if not it checks for the username.
29.) Some minor bugfixes.



Following features are new 1.6:
===============================
 1.) Usersettings in admin backend allows deleting of messages of certain users.
 2.) Message navigation can be enabled (when enabled uddeIM displays if responses
     to a message and the original message is available).
 3.) Statistics in backend improved.
 4.) mod_uddeIM improved (when AJAX is enabled, the floating box is shown when a 
     new message arrives).
 5.) Premium plugin for donators: Access to inbox via RSS Feed.
 6.) iGoogle gadget to access RSS Message Feed.
 7.) Premium plugin for donators: Public Frontend
 8.) You can force uddeIM not to load MooTools. In uddeIM 1.5 it was assumed that 
     MooTools 1.1 is loaded by the template, in uddeIM 1.6 you can select if 
     MooTools 1.1 or 1.2 is used.
 9.) Some security related improvements.
10.) Language file for Arabic added.
11.) Separator for multiple recipients can be selected (comma or semicolon).
12.) Autoforward can be enabled only for special users.
13.) Some code improvements (avoiding some redirection loops when called from 3rd
     party components and modules).
14.) "All users" list can be restricted to special users and admins only.
15.) Though there is a notice after uddeIM has been installed and there are a 
     README and a FAQ available, some users persistently ignore these documents.
     Now a red colored warning line will be shown when the database has not been 
     updated. I bet there are still some users who won't make it.
16.) Messages can be imported in parts. This might be necessary when you want to
     import lots of messages and the importer dies before finishing the import.
17.) A new CB plugin has been added: cb_plug_pms_uddeim_blocking. This plugin 
     adds a "Blocking" tab so you can block and unblock users quite easy.
18.) A small bug in plug_uddeim_pms_contentlink has been fixed.
19.) Character set was not converted for Autoresponder text when UTF-8 was used.
20.) Backend buttons use translated language strings.
21.) Vietnamese and Czech language file added.
22.) Global contact lists added (a global contact list is visible to all users).
23.) Restricted contact lists added (a restricted contact list can be accessed 
     by members only).
     Note: Even when the sender in on the contactlist (required when dealing with
	       restricted or global contact lists which can be used by other users), 
           the sender will not receive a message.
24.) Multiple selection from contact lists possible.
25.) A new CB plugin has been added: cb_plug_pms_uddeim_profilelink. This plugin 
     adds a simple link that points to the uddeIM compose page.
26.) Restriction of max. members on userlist was not enforced.
27.) Creating of userlists improved.
28.) Modernblue template fixed for IE.
29.) Some minor bugfixes.

Following features are new 1.5:
===============================
 1.) Autoresponder added (works for local users and public users).
 2.) When filtering users in the usersettings the boundaries where not checked correctly, so
     sometimes the filter does not show any result.
 3.) Autoforwarding added (users can forward new emails automatically to other users).
 4.) Some special characters have been sent encoded in email notifications (hope that this
     issue is fixed now).
 5.) You can specify the width, columns and rows of the message box in the backend.
 6.) Community Builder Enhanced for Joomla 1.5 is supported now.
 7.) Loading of javascript and style sheets is done in the header now (XHTML compatibility).
 8.) Language string "_UDDEIM_EMN_BODY_PUBLICWITHMESSAGE": meaning of %you% and %user% switched
     (it was not a bug but now it is consistent with other language strings).
 9.) Lots of improvements (e.g. improved layout in admin usersettings).
10.) New module: mod_uddeim_statistics (displays some statistics)
11.) New plugin: plug_uddeim_pms_contentlink (creates a link to uddeIM in articles)
        {pmslink:id=123}
        {pmslink:username=slabbi}
        {pmslink:realname=Stephan Slabihoud}

        {pmslink:realname=Stephan Slabihoud,Send Stephan a message}
12.) Filter for inbox, outbox and archive added.
13.) New CSS tag added: "uddeim-filter". This is used to style the extra line used by the filter.
14.) Trashcan performance improved for very large sites (messages are not longer sorted by 
     trash date but by creation date -> removes a "filesort" in the SQL query).
15.) Removed depricated mosMail in cb_plug_pms_uddeim on Joomla 1.5.
16.) mod_uddeim_mailbox did not load the CSS file when user was not logged in.
17.) Added a link to unarchive a message when the message is displayed.
18.) New icon added (so read the update instructions carefully).
19.) Most icons have "title" tag, now.
20.) Forgetmenot messages improved and bugfixed (less server load, sends messages to
     unblocked users only).



Following features are new 1.4:
===============================
 1.) Language file: You can use "%msglink%" in
       _UDDEIM_EMN_BODY_NOMESSAGE, _UDDEIM_EMN_BODY_WITHMESSAGE, _UDDEIM_EMN_FORGETMENOT.
     This displays a link which directly jumps to the received message. When you use
     this variable please pay attention to following notes:
      i) The user must be logged on (or must be remembered by Joomla) otherwise the user
         will see an error message (you are not allowed...).
     ii) When the user is not logged on and the public frontend is enabled the user
         will see the public front end instead off the received message.
 2.) Importer improved (shows all installed PMS now, not only one).
 3.) Bugfix: uddeIM did not send email notification on some Joomla installations.
 4.) Bugfix: Multiple messages could not be deleted when site was installed in a subdomain.
 5.) "Overwrite Itemid" is also regocognized by the main component and not only by the modules. 
 6.) mod_uddeim_mailbox shows link to contacts.
 7.) Renamed all functions and variables used to avoid conflicts with other modules.
 8.) Fixed a small problem with plug_pms_uddeim which has appeared on one system only.
 9.) Fixed a variable not initialized bug in modules and plugins.
10.) Updated Autocompleter for MooTools 1.2 to v1.2.1.
11.) Bugfix: Agora Avatars have not been displayed.



Following features are new 1.3:
===============================
 1.) uddeIM 1.3 runs on Joomla 1.x, J1.5 legacy and J1.5 native.
 2.) The text counter was not working when message length was set to zero. The bugfix 
     ensures that the text counter is not shown when the text length is set to zero, now.
 3.) Added check if iconv() is available (usually it should).
 4.) The Autocompleter can use MooTools 1.2, which supports multiple selections. You can
     specify the version of MooTools which uddeIM should use in the admin backend:
        "do not load MooTools":
            MooTools is NOT loaded by uddeIM (so when your template loads MooTools, 
            uddeIM does not load it twice).
        "auto":
            Same behavior as in uddeIM 1.2. uddeIM loads MooTools 1.11 when running under
            Joomla 1.0 and uses the internal MooTools library when running under Joomla 1.5.
        "force loading MooTools 1.1":
            Loads MooTools 1.11 library.
            Note that there is no check if MooTools is already loaded!
        "force loading MooTools 1.2":
            Loads MooTools 1.2 library.
            Note that there is no check if MooTools is already loaded!
     Joomla 1.5 users cannot use "MooTools 1.2" setting since Joomla 1.5 always loads 
     MooTools 1.11. Joomla 1.5 users have to use "auto" or "do not load MooTools".
 5.) uddeIM supports Agora Avatars and Profiles.
 6.) J1.5 XML installer added.
 7.) New uddeIM logo in backend.
 8.) Default values are shown in usersettings list in backend.
 9.) Annoying bug fixed which appeared when two or more menu entries with different access
     levels were used to call uddeIM.
10.) Pagination was broken in "uddeIM 1.3 experimental" on Joomla 1.0. This should be fixed.
11.) When your site was accessible in a sub folder the Autocompleter did not work because
     a absolute path was used in autocompleter.css.
     You can fix your own template when you replace
	   url(/components/com_uddeim/templates/<template>/images/spinner16.gif)
	 with
	   url(../images/spinner16.gif)
12.) Added an additional check so that json.php is not loaded twice on some systems.
13.) "No photo" avatar should be displayed with CBE now.



Following features are new 1.2:
===============================
 1.) A few minor changes.


Following features are new 1.2beta2:
====================================
 1.) FB requires an Itemid in order to show user profiles.
 2.) Trashcan queries optimized: querying the message list is only done when there are
     messages stored in the trashcan.
 3.) Added a fix that allows to store messages in base64 format in the database (so people
     with character encoding problems because of a wrong database setting have full UTF-8
     support).
 4.) When forwarding copy2me messages it looked like that sender and receiver have been 
     switched. Now these messages are handled in a special way, so the sender and receiver
	 are shown correctly.
 5.) Bugfix: forgetmenot emails were not sent in 1.1 and 1.2beta.
 6.) Language file contains "To" in upper case (used in captions) and lower case (used in
     "to Username").
 7.) Error fixed in plug_pms_uddeim when group blocking was used.
 8.) Importer added for myPMS OS 2.x
 9.) Importer added for myPMS Pro 1.x
10.) Importer added for JIM Reloaded 1.x
11.) Importer added for myPMS Enhanced 1.x
12.) JIM importer improved (already deleted messages are not undeleted)
13.) myPMS Enhanced importer improved (already deleted messages are not undeleted)

15.) When recalling a message the old recipient of the message is now used as default in the 
     recipient field.
16.) A checkbox allows adding a CC-lines when "Multi users" features is enabled. uddeIM does 
     only add this line below the message when two or more recipients have been entered.
17.) Forwarding a message does not display the full message on top of the text input field.
18.) mod_uddeim supports AJAX requests, so it shows new incoming messages immediately 
     (the floater and popup will currently NOT appear when a new message arrives).
19.) Greek translation (frontend only) added.
20.) Since a few people do not check the README before they update, I added a reminder in 
     the installation routine.

     frontend).
36.) Members of blocked groups will not be listed in autocompleter.
37.) Automatic login problem fixed on Joomla 1.5. uddeIM modules said "You are not logged in"
     when a user re-visited a site (nevertheless it was working fine after a page reload).

18.) Workaround for wrong encoded characters in CB connection messages when sent over 
     plug_pms_uddeim plugin. Note: Language files should not use hmtl entities, so you should check
     CBs language file first when you have problems with messages created by the Community      Builder.
19.) Obfuscating can be configured in plug_pms_uddeim (it does not longer use the component setting).
20.) Problem with Autocompleter on J!1.5 installations fixed.

44.) Floating box message notification implemmented in mod_uddeim.
45.) Import from "Clexus 2.0" possible.
46.) Admin backend improved (nicer layout).
47.) Welcome message on UTF-8 systems should be displayed correctly.

  http://yoursite/index.php?option=com_uddeim&task=settings
- Open new message dialog to user with userid XX:
  http://yoursite/index.php?option=com_uddeim&task=new&recip=XX
- Open new message dialog to user with username XX (this is independent from realname/username setting):
  http://yoursite/index.php?option=com_uddeim&task=new&runame=XX


Following features are new 0.9:
===============================
 1.) uddeIM should be compatible with J!1.5 in lagacy mode. This is still "experimental".
 2.) New configuration file. The configuration is stored in "config.class.php" now. 
     The old configuration is not migrated automatically, you have to review your settings after 
     updating to uddeIM 0.9. Newer versions will convert the configuration file automatically. 
 3.) When switching off the message archive uddeIM asks if archived messages should be kept in the 
     archive (they are not longer accessable by the user) or if the archived messages should be 
     moved back to the inbox.
 4.) The width of the message box in the default template is now 450px (was 300px).
 5.) Itemid will be preserved in uddeIM.
 6.) Some database performance improvements.
 7.) Recipient autocomplete feature.
 8.) uddeIM imports messages from myPMS II, myPMS Enhanced 2.x, JAM 1.x, Archaic Binary Private 
     Messages 1.x, and JIM 1.x.
 9.) uddeIM shows a statusline which is green when the configuration file is writeable and red
     otherwise.
10.) Import function for other PMS improved.
11.) Entering an unknown username or leaving the message field blank shows the corresponding field 
     in red color.
12.) Error handling improved (empty message, empty receiver, unknown receiver).
13.) Some CSS fixes (e.g. "Connections" in "New message" form was always printed in bold, now 
     you specify this in your CSS file).
14.) Multiple recipients can be enabled and disabled.
15.) You can select multiple recipients from the "All users" and "Connections" lists (switchable 
     in the backend).
16.) Text counter to avoid truncated messages (switchable in backend).
17.) Configuration settings in backend which are not available are printed in gray now.
18.) Inbox listing allows archiving of messages.
19.) Messages can be unarchived from archive.
20.) Some minor bugfixes.


Following features are new 0.8:
===============================
 1.) Cleaned up the code a little bit again.
 2.) When a message is recalled and send again, uddeIM does not longer send an additional 
     notification email.
 3.) Import tab in admin backend was shown again when settings were saved.
 4.) New emoticons from KOLOBOK.us.

     Note:
     a) Animated emoticons are available for all themes exept "noir" now (maybe someone can
        convert all emoticons in "/templates/~~~theme~~~/animated"?).
     b) Extended emoticons can be stored in a folder "/templates/~~~theme~~~/animated-extended".
        For the default template about 32 animated emoticons are provided. If you need more you
        can copy as many emoticons in this folder as you like. The filename is used to identify
        an emoticon in the pm (e.g. "cry.gif" will be entered as ":cry:").

 5.) Switch between static and animated emoticons.
 6.) Delete link is available when a message is read from the outbox folder.
 7.) "uddeIM Notify" module for people who do not use Community Builder (this module also
     supports popups).
 8.) Notifications to a new users will be sent even when these users have not used uddeIM before 
     and default for notifications is set to always in backend.

 9.) "Message Encryption" has been implemented. When this feature is enabled users can secure 
     messages with an encryption key (called "Password" in the frontend since not everyone knows 
     the difference between a "password" and a "key"). Messages can only be read when the correct 
     key is provided. When no key is entered uddeIM falls back to "Message obfuscating".

     Warning: This is an experimental feature. Use is with care.
     When you are unsure what to do enable "Message obfuscating" only. 
     You can enable encryption whenever you like.

10.) There are checkboxes in the inbox, outbox, trash and archive now. These checkboxes allow
     to delete multiple messages at the same time. You can choose between text and icon layout.
11.) About 50 minor bugs and CSS layout bugs fixed.
12.) Messages can be pruned in the backend manually.
13.) User settings link was not shown when popups where enabled and notifications not.
14.) When CB avatars are enabled, "no picture" avatar is displayed when user has no avatar.
15.) Icons for menubar, bottom links and action links can be enabled/disabled seperately.
16.) The maintenance function has been improved and checks for a few database errors (useful when
     you have updated from uddeIM 0.5 and below or when 3rd party software writes in uddeIM's
     database tables).
17.) Some configuration variables have changed (this allows to make uddeIM compatible to J!1.5 
     in near future).
18.) uddeIM allows multiple receivers now. Just enter all names seperated with an ",". To send
     a message to Alice and Bob, enter "alice,bob".
     There is a small consmetic issue with this feature when blocking is enabled. When one
     user blocks you, you will get a message that the message has not been sent. You have to try 
     again and to re-enter the message and all recipients. None of the non-blocking recipients 
     will get the message.

Note: uddeIM 0.8b does not use strong encryption (a encryption algorithm like DES, 3DES or AES).
      uddeIM uses a vernam cipher which is based on a simple password as key stream (usually this 
      should be a randomized bit stream). So uddeIM encryption feature is actually not unbreakable 
      but good enough for our purposes (maybe I implement strong encryption in a future version).


Following features are new 0.7:
===============================
 1.) Messages are obfuscated in the DB to prevent accidentally reading (real encryption in 
     not yet implemented)
 2.) The default value for email notifications can be set in the backend (a change is only
     valid for users who have not changed their preferences yet).
     Note: If you want to set email notifications for all users you have to 
     set "_uddeim_emn->status=1" for all users with e.g. phpMyAdmin.
 3.) You can suppress the "All users" link in write new message dialog.
 4.) Performance has been optimized when avatars have been enabled in message lists.
 5.) Performance has been optimized for all database queries.
 6.) Cleaned up the code a little bit
 7.) When an email notification is sent the REPLY-TO header is set to the recipient's address,
     so replies to notifications are usually not sent to the administrative address.
 8.) You can enable popup support in uddeIM now. UddeIM does not display popups itself. When
     this setting is enabled in the admin backend, users can enable/disable popups in the 
     uddeIM user settings.
     Actually you have to install a patched "mod_cblogin" (e.g. "mod_cblogin_11pl2") so that 
     popups are displayed.
 9.) The default for popup notification can be set in the backend (a change is only
     valid for users who have not changed their preferences yet).
10.) Systemmessages were not purged from the database even when they were deleted from the inbox.
11.) Repeatedly performed checks for __pms table each time you called the admin backend fixed.
12.) New maintenance tab in admin backend added. When users are deleted from the database 
     messages are usually still stored in the database. This function trashes orphaned messages 
     send to or written by deleted users.
12.) Messages sent as copy to yourself were never purged from the database (they have not be shown 
     in uddeIM but still were stored in the database).
13.) Problem with infinite redirects when not logged in fixed.


Following features are new 0.6:
===============================
 1.) Sender can delete messages from the outbox
 2.) You can switch between Realnames / Usernames in admin backend
 3.) When creating a new message uddeIM shows *your* connections (that means connections to 
     other users instead of connections from other users to you)
