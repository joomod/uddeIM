this is the "classic" com_search component for Joomla5
- without the basic search plugins 
  (content, contacts, categories, newsfeed, tags)
- but including the uddeim_searchbot plugin

as the new smart-search (com-finder) component is not usefull for a
PM system (to keep privacy search is only done within user's pms, so
smart search would have to index pms for each user seperatly,
it is best way to use the "old" com_search to integrate a PM search

to use, the module and the plug_uddeim_searchbot must be enabled!

Warning:  
as some extensions comes with no longer valid search plugins
be shure to DISABLE ALL search plugins other than UddeIM_searchbot 
 

looking for the basic plugins?

be careful:
***********
the original com_search src has still two J5 errors:

1. administrator/tmpl/searches/default.php line 60:
   replace \JFilterOutput::  with \Joomla\CMS\Filter\OutputFilter::

2. components/com_search/src/Controller/DisplayController.php  line 82:
   replace \JFilterInput::  with \Joomla\CMS\Filter\InputFilter::
